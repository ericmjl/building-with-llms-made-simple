    # Introduction to LLM APIs with SimpleBot

    In this notebook, we'll learn how to interact with LLMs using LlamaBot's `SimpleBot` interface.
    We'll start with basic interactions and build up to creating a paper abstract generator.
    This notebook should take us no more than 15 minutes to complete within the tutorial setting as a class.

    ## Creating Your First SimpleBot

    Let's start by creating a simple bot and understanding the basic components of an LLM interaction.

    LLM interactions are, for the vast majority of applications, controlled by an API call.
    The absolute basics of this API call are that it needs structured with the following components:

    - A system prompt, which sets the language model's persona across API calls (it is kept constant)
    - A model name specifying which language model
    - A user prompt, which sets the specific interaction that a user wants to have with the LM

    Let's see it in action.
