    Welcome! I put this tutorial together to share what I know about building using LLMs.

    ## Learning Goals

    By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

    1. Build Python program that use Large Language Model APIs as part of the mix,
    2. Define "Structured Generation" and its utility
    3. More here...

    More over, I think an important concept we'll learn is that LLMs can be injected **surgically** into our applications to create magical experiences.

    ## Prerequisites

    1. You should be able to write Python code.
    2. You should have `uv` installed on your system. Best done by the official shell script one-liner on the [`uv` installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
    3. You should be able to run `uvx marimo edit --sandbox /path/to/some/notebook.py` to run the Marimo notebooks.

    ## AI Coding Policy

    No policies needed!

    I expect you to be using AI assistance actively,
    [but to do so autodidactically](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/6/7/principles-for-using-ai-autodidactically/).
    The goal is for you to master AI assistance as a tool for convenience
    while maintaining the discipline to flex your learning muscles.

    ## Technical Logistics

    By this point, you should have followed the installation instructions for Ollama
    and should have also downloaded a few of the smaller-sized LLMs
    that are designed to fit within 16GB RAM systems on CPU.

    However, if for whatever reason you have not done so, do not fret!
    I have deployed Ollama on Modal (see [this repo](https://github.com/ericmjl/ollama-on-modal) for instructions on how you can do so too).
    The kind folks at Modal have also given me enough credits to spend for June and July
    that can support usage at this tutorial.
