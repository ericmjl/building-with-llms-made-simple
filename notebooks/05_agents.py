    # Building Autonomous Agents

    Using LlamaBot, you can build agents that autonomously execute workflows on your behalf.
    In some ways, the bots you have already built (the `StructuredBot`s, for example),
    are "autonomous" in a sense -- you can use them to fill in pydantic models
    like a human fills out a form.

    But could we take autonomy further?

    That's what this notebook is all about.

    ## Tools

    Merely being able to fill a form
    might not be sufficiently satisfying definition for an "agent".
    Instead, we may want an agent to take actions,
    in particular, the two general activities of:

    1. Querying the external world for information, and
    2. Modifying state of the external world

    Within LlamaBot, we have a `tool` decorator
    that makes Python functions available to `AgentBot`.
    For those in the know, MCP server access is on the way!

    The `tool` decorator modifies a function
    by parsing its function signature and docstring
    and adding a `.json_schema attribute to it.
    It is this JSON schema that gets passed into an LLM,
    which will then decide whether, given the current context,
    it should call on a function or not,
    using the JSON schema to anchor its outputs.

    Let's see an example of the `@tool` decorator in action.
